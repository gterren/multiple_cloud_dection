# Detection of Clouds in Multiple Wind Velocity Fields

This repository includes the files necessary for the implementation of the cloud dection algorithm explained in article XX.

## Mixture Models

The mixture models with different distribution that were implemented in the article are in the file detection_clustering_utils.py.

## Cloud Segmentation

The cloud segmentation algorithms in the repositoty https://github.com/gterren/cloud_segmentation are implemented for real time applications in this file cloud_segmentation_utils.py.

## Velocity Vectors

Different optical flow implementation are in file . These include: Pyramidal Lucas-Kanade, Weithed Lucas-Kanade, Pyramidal Weighted Lucas-Kanade, Cross-Correlation, Normalized Cross-Correlation, Honk-Schunk and more...
